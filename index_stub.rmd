# Your Elected Officials


```{r init, include=FALSE}
## load API keys
source("keys.R")
## you may also load necessary libraries and set various options here
library(dplyr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error=TRUE)
                           # continue compiling on error
```

```{r address, include=FALSE}
## insert your address here.  It does not to have quite complete.
address <- "San Francisco, CA"
## Test your code with addresses in different states, see if it works
## Note that if you change the address, your code must re-load the data and re-do the tables and figures. 
```

```{r processData}
## Make the main computations here.  Keep the functions in a separate file(s)
## and only include the final operations here.
## You have to 'source()' your main R file(s) here:
source('process_data.R')
## You may also have to do some additional processing here
```

## Your Representatives

Explain briefly what and how do you do here.  Provide links to the
corresponding API-s.

Include a table that includes all the officials for the given addres.

## when you have already created it.
knitr::kable(repTable)
```

## House of Representatives

Make the visualization of party affiliation of the the congressional representatives
(in the House of Representatives, _not_ the Senate) for this address.

```{r}
